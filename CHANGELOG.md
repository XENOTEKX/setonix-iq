# IQ-TREE GPU Offload — Development Progress

## Status: Project initialized, profiling complete, GPU implementation not started

Profiling complete (VTune + perf, April 2026). Five hot functions identified in `phylokernelnew.h` consuming >95% CPU time. GPU PoC exists with CUDA/cuBLAS backends but needs HIP port for Setonix AMD MI250X GPUs. No GPU kernels have been validated against CPU oracle output yet.

### GPU kernel speedup targets

No GPU measurements yet. Expected based on workload characteristics:
- `computeLikelihoodDervSIMD`: 5,000 independent patterns × ~60 FLOPs each → excellent GPU occupancy
- `computeLikelihoodBufferSIMD`: pure element-wise multiply → memory-bandwidth bound on GPU
- `computeLikelihoodBranchSIMD`: dot product + log + reduction → good GPU fit

## Changelog

### 20 April 2026 (c): hpc-01 dashboard hosting + commit-back pipeline

**Architecture change — private dashboard served from hpc-01:**
- GitHub Pages requires Pro for private repos — switched to commit-back approach
- GitHub Action now generates `dashboard.html` + `docs/index.html` and commits back to repo with `[skip ci]`
- Created `host.sh` for hpc-01: HTTP server (screen) + cron auto-refresh every 5 min
- Full pipeline: Setonix pushes data → Action generates dashboard → hpc-01 cron pulls → serves on HTTP
- Updated `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with full architecture diagram and Pawsey network policy notes
- Added `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true` to avoid Node.js 20 deprecation warnings

### 20 April 2026 (b): GitHub Actions CI/CD overhaul + Setonix baseline hotspots

**CI/CD overhaul — data-only pushes from Setonix, Action generates website:**
- Created `.github/workflows/build-dashboard.yml`:
  - Triggers on push to `main` when `logs/`, `serve.py`, or `website/` change
  - Runs `python3 serve.py` to generate `docs/index.html` from committed JSON logs
  - Validates output (file exists, size > 1KB, contains expected marker)
  - Commits generated dashboard back to repo (see 20c for final approach)
- Updated `.gitignore` — generated files (`dashboard.html`, `docs/`, `PROFILING_REPORT.html`, `website/api/runs.json`) are not tracked
- Updated `start.sh`:
  - `cmd_start`, `cmd_pipeline`, `cmd_profile`, `cmd_deepprofile` no longer call `serve.py` before pushing
  - These commands now push data only; GitHub Action generates the dashboard
  - `cmd_generate` preserved for local preview (runs `serve.py` without pushing)
  - Updated usage comments to reflect new workflow
- Created `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` documenting the full architecture

**Hotspot/callstack data from perf record:**
- Parsed `perf report` output into 3 baseline run JSONs (large_mf_1t, large_mf_64t, xlarge_mf_1t)
- Each run now includes `hotspots[]` (self%, children%, samples, function, module) and `callstacks{}` (total_samples, top_stacks[50])
- Key findings:
  - 1T: computePartialLikelihoodSIMD dominates at 84.66%
  - 64T: drops to 52.97% as OpenMP overhead and DervSIMD increase proportionally
  - xlarge_mf shows DervSIMD at 23.56% (vs 9.73% for large_mf) — more patterns shift compute balance

**`data.py` — merge additional run JSONs:**
- After building runs from `time_log_*.tsv` files, also loads all `*.json` from `logs/runs/`
- Deduplicates by `run_id` so Setonix pipeline runs and baseline profiles coexist

### 20 April 2026 (a): Dashboard UI/UX redesign + IQ-TREE Configuration card

**Overview page cleanup:**
- Removed 3 useless stat cards from overview (Best IPC, Cache Miss Rate, Deep Profiles) — these showed static, out-of-context numbers
- Replaced with: **Best Speedup** (calculated across all runs comparing multi-threaded vs 1T baselines) and **Fastest Run** (best wall time across all runs)
- Added stat card icons (`.stat-icon`) for visual distinction

**IQ-TREE Configuration card (new):**
- Added `renderOverviewConfig()` function — shows 3-column config grid on overview page when a run is selected
- Sections: Alignment (dataset, taxa, sites, data type, file size, patterns, informative/constant sites, free params), Model & Results (model, rate heterogeneity, gamma alpha, threads, log-likelihood, BIC, tree length, wall time), System (CPU, cores, memory, L3, GPU, ROCm, GCC, NUMA, hostname)
- Tries to match deep profiles by dataset name for richer alignment/system data
- Shows the IQ-TREE command line with copy button
- Added `copyOverviewConfig()` — exports full config as formatted text to clipboard
- Added HTML container (`#overviewConfigCard`) to overview page

**CSS modernization (UI/UX redesign):**
- Darker, more refined color palette (--bg: #060a13, --surface: #0d1321, --card: #131b2e)
- Added card elevation system: `--shadow-card` and `--shadow-hover` with subtle inset highlights
- Stat cards now have hover lift effect (translateY + glow border)
- All cards get hover border-color transition
- Added `font-feature-settings` for Inter font (cv02, cv03, cv04, cv11)
- Tightened spacing throughout (padding, gaps, font sizes)
- Added `.config-grid`, `.config-section`, `.config-items`, `.config-item`, `.ci-label`, `.ci-value`, `.config-cmd` CSS classes
- Responsive breakpoints updated for config-grid (3→2→1 columns)
- Sidebar slightly narrower (260px→240px), refined nav link sizing
- Added `--bg-tertiary` variable for nested surfaces (command blocks)

**Bug fix:** Re-added `feStall` variable declaration in `renderOverview()` — was removed with the stat cards but still used by `latestProfileCard`.

### 19 April 2026: Comprehensive profiling report + Setonix cross-platform comparison

**What was done:**
- Created `PROFILING_REPORT.html` — a comprehensive, downloadable HTML profiling report combining hpc-01 (Intel Sandy Bridge) and Setonix (AMD EPYC Trento) profiling data
- 16 sections with table of contents, page breaks for printing, explanations for non-technical readers, jargon glossary, colour-coded findings, ASCII bar charts, and a download button
- Cross-platform comparison: Setonix 4T is **2.54× faster** than hpc-01 4T on medium_dna GTR+G4 (26.9s vs 68.2s), with **2.15× better IPC** (2.30 vs 1.07) and **~30× reduction in frontend stalls** (2.23% vs 65.71%)
- Function hotspot ranking is identical across both platforms (DervSIMD ~39%, PartialLikelihood ~33%, Buffer ~10%), confirming GPU offload targets are architecture-independent
- Added `PROFILING_REPORT.html` to `.gitignore` (generated report, not tracked in repo)
- Fixed `dashboard.html` and `serve.py` rendering bug (stray JS from template replacement — see entry below)

**Setonix baselines added:**
| Config | Wall time | CPU time | IPC | Frontend stalls |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----|-----------------|
| turtle.fa 1T GTR+G4 | 1.62s | 1.49s | 2.334 | 3.12% |
| medium_dna 4T GTR+G4 | 26.9s | 102.5s | 2.299 | 2.23% |

**Next:** Run larger datasets on Setonix (Default pipeline without `-m` to test ModelFinder path), then begin Phase 1 CUDA→HIP port.

### 18 April 2026: Fix dashboard.html rendering — JS was broken by serve.py generator

**Root cause:** `serve.py` used `template.index('loadData();')` which matched the first occurrence of the substring — inside `await loadData();` within the `refreshData()` function body — instead of the standalone `loadData();` call at the end of the script. This caused the replacement to leave a stray `}` (closing brace of `refreshData()`) followed by all the original template's ES6 render functions duplicated after the generated ES5 code. The stray `}` was an immediate syntax error that prevented any JS from executing.

**Fixes applied:**
- `dashboard.html` / `docs/index.html`: Removed ~280 lines of duplicate ES6 template code (stray `}` + all duplicate render functions + duplicate `loadData();` + `setInterval`) that were appended after the generated script
- `serve.py`: Changed `template.index(old_script_end)` → `template.rindex(old_script_end)` to match the LAST occurrence of `loadData();` in the template, preventing this bug on future regenerations

**Verified:** `node --check` passes on extracted JS. Dashboard opens and renders data, charts, and all 6 pages correctly.

### 18 April 2026: Project initialization

**What was done:**
- Comprehensive VTune + perf profiling across 5 configurations (Default 1T/4T/8T, GTR 1T/4T)
- Identified five hot functions in `phylokernelnew.h` consuming >95% of CPU time
- Documented GPU PoC structure and capabilities (`poc-gpu-likelihood-calculation-main/`)
- Created CLAUDE.md with project context, architecture, kernel designs, development principles
- Created CHANGELOG.md (this file) for progress tracking
- Established 5-phase implementation plan
- Identified Setonix target: AMD MI250X GPUs → need HIP/ROCm port of CUDA kernels

**Current state of GPU PoC:**
- Working multi-backend GPU likelihood calculator (`gpulcal` binary)
- CUDA kernels: `MatrixKernels.cu` (hadamard, scaling, composite fused), `TipLikelihoodKernel.cu`
- K-specialized templates: DNA (K=4, register-cached) and protein (K=20, shared-mem)
- cuBLAS backend with async streams and CUDA events
- Limitations: only JC/POISSON models, no GTR/HKY, CUDA-only (no HIP), test scripts are stubs, no IQ-TREE integration

**Key profiling insights:**
- GPU offload eliminates three CPU bottlenecks simultaneously: OpenMP spin-wait (22-29% at 4T+), frontend stalls (52% → 70% with threads), backend stalls (17% → 48%)
- All datasets fit in MI250X 128 GB HBM2e (even stress_dna at 500 MB)
- Patterns are independent → perfect GPU parallelism for DervSIMD, BufferSIMD, BranchSIMD
- PartialLikelihoodSIMD has tree-order dependencies → must launch per-node in post-order
- `computeLikelihoodBranchSIMD` was hidden by `-m GTR+G4` (skips ModelFinder); visible in default pipeline

**Next steps (ordered by priority):**
1. Port GPU PoC CUDA kernels to HIP for Setonix MI250X
2. Build and validate PoC on Setonix GPU node
3. Implement `computeLikelihoodDervSIMD` HIP kernel (highest impact: 40-52% of CPU time)
4. Write correctness tests comparing GPU output to CPU oracle

## Implementation phases

- [ ] **Phase 1:** Port CUDA→HIP, build on Setonix, validate PoC
- [ ] **Phase 2:** HIP kernel for `computeLikelihoodDervSIMD` (40-52% of CPU time)
- [ ] **Phase 3:** HIP kernel for `computePartialLikelihoodSIMD` (18.3% of CPU time)
- [ ] **Phase 4:** HIP kernels for Buffer/Branch (3.8% + 0.3% of CPU time)
- [ ] **Phase 5:** Integration with IQ-TREE tree search loop + end-to-end benchmarks

## Confirmed correct (do not re-investigate)

- **Frontend stalls are the dominant 1T bottleneck** (52.4%), caused by large templated/inlined AVX instruction footprint. A GPU eliminates this entirely.
- **OpenMP scaling is sublinear** — 8T uses >2× the CPU cycles of 1T (484.5s vs 230.8s). Extra cycles are OpenMP barrier sync + cache coherence.
- **Hierarchy truncation is NOT a factor** in IQ-TREE accuracy (per upstream IQ-TREE development).
- **Branch misprediction is negligible** (0.08%) — not worth optimizing.
- **LLC miss rate is low** (1.89%) — working set fits in cache. The bottleneck is I-cache (frontend), not D-cache.

## Failed approaches (do not re-attempt)

- (None yet — record failures here as they occur)
