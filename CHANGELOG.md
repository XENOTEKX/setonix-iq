# IQ-TREE GPU Offload — Development Progress

## Status: Project initialized, profiling complete, GPU implementation not started

Profiling complete (VTune + perf, April 2026). Five hot functions identified in `phylokernelnew.h` consuming >95% CPU time. GPU PoC exists with CUDA/cuBLAS backends but needs HIP port for Setonix AMD MI250X GPUs. No GPU kernels have been validated against CPU oracle output yet.

### GPU kernel speedup targets

No GPU measurements yet. Expected based on workload characteristics:
- `computeLikelihoodDervSIMD`: 5,000 independent patterns × ~60 FLOPs each → excellent GPU occupancy
- `computeLikelihoodBufferSIMD`: pure element-wise multiply → memory-bandwidth bound on GPU
- `computeLikelihoodBranchSIMD`: dot product + log + reduction → good GPU fit

## Changelog

### 18 April 2026: Project initialization

**What was done:**
- Comprehensive VTune + perf profiling across 5 configurations (Default 1T/4T/8T, GTR 1T/4T)
- Identified five hot functions in `phylokernelnew.h` consuming >95% of CPU time
- Documented GPU PoC structure and capabilities (`poc-gpu-likelihood-calculation-main/`)
- Created CLAUDE.md with project context, architecture, kernel designs, development principles
- Created CHANGELOG.md (this file) for progress tracking
- Established 5-phase implementation plan
- Identified Setonix target: AMD MI250X GPUs → need HIP/ROCm port of CUDA kernels

**Current state of GPU PoC:**
- Working multi-backend GPU likelihood calculator (`gpulcal` binary)
- CUDA kernels: `MatrixKernels.cu` (hadamard, scaling, composite fused), `TipLikelihoodKernel.cu`
- K-specialized templates: DNA (K=4, register-cached) and protein (K=20, shared-mem)
- cuBLAS backend with async streams and CUDA events
- Limitations: only JC/POISSON models, no GTR/HKY, CUDA-only (no HIP), test scripts are stubs, no IQ-TREE integration

**Key profiling insights:**
- GPU offload eliminates three CPU bottlenecks simultaneously: OpenMP spin-wait (22-29% at 4T+), frontend stalls (52% → 70% with threads), backend stalls (17% → 48%)
- All datasets fit in MI250X 128 GB HBM2e (even stress_dna at 500 MB)
- Patterns are independent → perfect GPU parallelism for DervSIMD, BufferSIMD, BranchSIMD
- PartialLikelihoodSIMD has tree-order dependencies → must launch per-node in post-order
- `computeLikelihoodBranchSIMD` was hidden by `-m GTR+G4` (skips ModelFinder); visible in default pipeline

**Next steps (ordered by priority):**
1. Port GPU PoC CUDA kernels to HIP for Setonix MI250X
2. Build and validate PoC on Setonix GPU node
3. Implement `computeLikelihoodDervSIMD` HIP kernel (highest impact: 40-52% of CPU time)
4. Write correctness tests comparing GPU output to CPU oracle

## Implementation phases

- [ ] **Phase 1:** Port CUDA→HIP, build on Setonix, validate PoC
- [ ] **Phase 2:** HIP kernel for `computeLikelihoodDervSIMD` (40-52% of CPU time)
- [ ] **Phase 3:** HIP kernel for `computePartialLikelihoodSIMD` (18.3% of CPU time)
- [ ] **Phase 4:** HIP kernels for Buffer/Branch (3.8% + 0.3% of CPU time)
- [ ] **Phase 5:** Integration with IQ-TREE tree search loop + end-to-end benchmarks

## Confirmed correct (do not re-investigate)

- **Frontend stalls are the dominant 1T bottleneck** (52.4%), caused by large templated/inlined AVX instruction footprint. A GPU eliminates this entirely.
- **OpenMP scaling is sublinear** — 8T uses >2× the CPU cycles of 1T (484.5s vs 230.8s). Extra cycles are OpenMP barrier sync + cache coherence.
- **Hierarchy truncation is NOT a factor** in IQ-TREE accuracy (per upstream IQ-TREE development).
- **Branch misprediction is negligible** (0.08%) — not worth optimizing.
- **LLC miss rate is low** (1.89%) — working set fits in cache. The bottleneck is I-cache (frontend), not D-cache.

## Failed approaches (do not re-attempt)

- (None yet — record failures here as they occur)
